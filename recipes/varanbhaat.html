    <h1>Varan Bhaat</h1>

    <h2>Varan Bhaat is a simple and quick Maharashtrian style dal (lentils curry) and rice recipe.</h2>

        <p>
            The Maharashtrian dish Varan Bhaat holds a special place in my 
            heart as it evokes nostalgic memories of my childhood spent with cousins, 
            enjoying hearty meals of VBT (Varan-Bhaat-Tup) paired with freshly pickled mango. 
            It's amazing how food and memories are intertwined and can transport us back in time. 
            This simple yet satisfying meal is a significant part of Maharashtrian 
            identity and always makes me feel like I'm back home.

            The tender mutton once coated and cooked in the masala, will literally fall off the bone, 
            a dish that you will want to make for your family this weekend.
