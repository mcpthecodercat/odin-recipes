    <h2>Malvani Mutton Curry is also known as Muttonache Rassa (in Marathi). 
        It is a traditional recipe from the South Konkan region of Maharashtra, in India.</h2>

        <p>
            Malvan being a coastal area in Konkan, it has its own distinct way of cooking food. 
           Malvani cuisine uses coconut liberally in various forms such as grated, dry grated, fried, coconut paste and coconut milk. 
           Many masalas have dried red chilies and other spices like coriander seeds, peppercorns, cumin, cardamom, ginger, garlic, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            The tender mutton once coated and cooked in the masala, will literally fall off the bone, 
            a dish that you will want to make for your family this weekend.
